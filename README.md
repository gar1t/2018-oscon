Status: proposal draft

## Title

Options:

- Deep learning models as packaged software with Guild AI

- Deep learning models as packaged software using Guild AI


## Description

Guild AI is a toolset for creating and using deep learning models as
packaged software. Like Homebrew, npm, and pip, Guild supports the
full software life cycle: packaging, publishing, search, installation,
and execution. In this presentation, you'll learn how deep learning
models can be marshalled as software units that encourage open
collaboration, sharing and reuse.

## Abstract

Software packages enable software ecosystems. Look no further than
Linux, MacOS (Homebrew), Node.js, or Python! Each of these
communities is supported by excellent tooling for packaging,
distributing, and consuming software.

Guild AI provides comparable tooling for the deep learning community.

While similar to traditional software, which is created by hand, a
deep learning model is trained using data and sophisticated
algorithms. The process is computationally expensive and time
consuming, but the results can be stunning: superhuman performance in
complex applications such as image recognition, text and speech
translation - steps toward a general artificial intelligence.

Guild AI makes it trivial to package and consume this new breed of
software.

This presentation will address the requiments of deep learning models
as packaged software:

- Model architecture
- Operations (e.g. train, fine-tune, and test)
- Data requirements
- Hyper parameters
- Logging and model export
- Fine-tuning
- Prediction interface
- Runtime environment

You'll learn how the complexities of this software can be hidden
behind a simple high-level interface:

- Package
- Search
- Install
- Run
- Compare
- Deploy

If you're actively building deep learning models or looking to
incorporate deep learning into your development process, this
presentation will give you a framework for approaching model reuse and
introduce Guild AI's feature set for enabling deep learning models as
packaged software.


## Target audience

Machine learners, software developers, and those interested in the
intersection of deep learning and programming

## Audience takeaway

Audience members will learn how deep learning models can be structured
as software units for reuse. This is an important topic for building
communities: software that's easy to discover, install, and use
encourages more development, collaboration, and sharing. Without this,
it's hard for a community to grow and flourish.

As stated in the abstract, a deep learning model is a form of
software. You can install it and use it to perform work like other
units of software. Models however are different from traditional forms
of software in a number of ways and as a result require unique
tooling.

In learning about these topics, audience members will learn about the
practical application of deep learning. The presentation will
complement other coverage of deep learning with a technical vision for
the future of deep learning as a software ecosystem.

## Prerequisite knowledge

This is a technical talk primary about software tooling. Attendees
should be familiar with deep learning at a high level, but are not
required to understand it at depth.
